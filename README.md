üìö [API docs](https://docs.fourthwall.com/storefront)

## Getting started

There are a few prerequisites to get started with Fourthwall's Storefront API.

1. [Set up a store](https://fourthwall.com/get-started) on Fourthwall.

2. [Make some products](https://my-shop.fourthwall.com/admin/dashboard/products/all/) and [create a collection](https://my-shop.fourthwall.com/admin/dashboard/products/collections/).

3. After you have signed up, [get a storefront token](https://my-shop.fourthwall.com/admin/dashboard/settings/for-developers).

4. Fill out the environment variables below in .env.local.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_FW_STOREFRONT_TOKEN="<your storefront token>" # Example: ptkn_...

NEXT_PUBLIC_FW_CHECKOUT="<your store url>" # Example: vercel-shop.fourthwall.com. Used for checkout
NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL="<the url of your vercel site>" # Example: fw-commerce.vercel.app. This is used for sitemap.xml + robots.txt.

# Optional
NEXT_PUBLIC_FW_COLLECTION="<the handle of your collection>" # If you want to display a specific collection. See Resources for more details on how to get the collection handle.
```

## Develop locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js Commerce. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env.local` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env.local` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to use your Fourthwall store.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

## Deploying

After cloning the repo with the Deploy with Vercel button above, you will need to set the environment variables.

```bash
git clone _your repo_ # your repo that you set up with Deploy with Vercel

vercel # From your repo directory. Links to your project

vercel # Initializes the project
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_FW_COLLECTION
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_FW_STOREFRONT_TOKEN
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_FW_CHECKOUT
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL

vercel --prod # Deploys to production
```
